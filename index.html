			</div>
			<p>The above tablet from the 7th century is a prime example of another innovation that lead to the rise of the Khmer. The tablet records a shipment of salt to several temples dedicated to Shiva. Shiva's Bull, Nandin, acts as a seal across the top. This tablet is one of the earliest known uses of Old Khmer, the script adopted by the Khmer Empire. A modified form of Sanskrit, Old Khmer was used in the day to day practical matters of the empire, such as trade. Old Khmer was enormously important to the Khmer, as it helped to organize the wide scale trade the Khmer engaged in on the Southeast Asian River network.  Pure Sanskrit, taken directly from India, was reserved for royal and religious proclamations only.</p>

			<p>Above is a statue of Jayavarman II, the founder of the Khmer Empire. The statue would have been one of many statues of Jayavarman II to adorn the entrance to a temple. This statue illustrates one of the most important factors attributing to the rise of the Khmer, the introduction of the God King, or Deva Raja from India. A form of divine right, the Deva Raja claimed to have a connection with the Hindu gods and used this claim as justification for his rule. He further consecrated this connection with the adoption of a religious name, either the name name of a God or attribute followed by the Suffix "-varman" meaning "protected by." The Deva Raja was revered by the subjects of the Khmer Empire, thusly allowing the Emperor to mobilize large portions of the empire to quickly and effectively build public works and religious monuments, as well as raising huge armies for expansion and defense. The national unity and absolute power created by the introduction of the concept of the "Deva Raja" may have been the major factor in the successful building of the Khmer Empire.</p>

			<p>Above is an aerial photograph of West Baray, in modern day Cambodia. These huge man made lakes, called Barays, were used as reservoirs  fed by a complex series of canals created by Khmer engineers. The Baray's helped the Khmer overcome the major challenge of water management in a region that alternated dry and wet seasons. With the divine authority invested in the Deva Raja, he was able to mobilize the mass amounts of manpower necessary to construct these huge reservoirs. Four of the Barays still remain today.<p>

			<p>The Khmer Empire was very religious, and many of its initial religious ideas were evolved from Indian ones. Many of the early kings promoted Hindu gods, such as Rudravarman in 500 CE. The Hindu trinity was especially noted, mostly Shiva and Vishnu. Many of the temples were dedicated to one of these gods or smaller gods and avatars. However, once Buddhism was introduced to Cambodia at around the same time by Chinese traders, Buddhism started to take hold in the region. For a long time, however, rulers stuck with Hinduism in order to justify class divisions (not caste system). Both these cultures and religions began to meld, and by the time of Jayavarman VII (1181–about 1218), both religions had fused thoroughly. In this bronze statue, the prevailing force of Buddhism is clear. In the center, the Buddha sits as the "apex" deity, and he is protected by Hindu smaller gods in some cases (not in this one). Also, Jayavarman VII chose to use Buddha protected by two nagas (which are Hindu), representing both religions, with a prevalent Buddhism.</p>

			<p>The Khmer Empire in 700 CE was in a time of political turmoil. During this time, fiefdoms ruled the many small regions which would later make up the larger Khmer Empire. Also, battles for land and territory frequently ensued, and the empire was in need of a stable government. In 802, Jayavarman II established himself as the founder of the Khmer Empire. He unified the split fiefdoms into a single centralized government headed by him, and establishes a capital at Hariharalaya. Though Jayavarman II managed to unify the Khmer Empire, political strife continued to characterize much of Khmer's history. Periodic fighting continues between kingdoms, and after almost a decade of fighting between rival fiefdoms, Suryavarman I starts ruling in 1011. One of the major contributors to the height of the Khmer Empire was a centralized government, and this only occurred after fighting between fiefdoms was kept under control by emperors. Therefore, the above image shows a carving of fighting. Also, many other tribes were constantly competing with the Khmer for power, and in order to stay in power, fighting was necessary for much of Khmer history. From 1113-1129, sporadic battles took place between different tribes. This painting may have also been used to legitimize the power of a king, by praising his military strength.</p>

			<p>Angkor Wat is one of the most iconic temples of Cambodia today, and is featured on its well-deserved position on the Cambodian flag. It is known to many as the 7th Wonder of the World, and this amazing structure was built during the reign of the Khmer Empire. In 1113, Suryavarman II built the Angkor Wat, a temple dedicated to Hinduism and Buddhism. Theravada Buddhism was prevalent in the later stages of the temple, especially with tons of lotus decorations, but Hindu influence is also clear. Apsaras, beautiful Hindu celestial dancers, have many statues. Also, pillars are engraved with both Sanskrit (from Hinduism), and Khmer (language). Therefore, this advanced temple shows a major architectural feat as well as religious syncretism.</p>

			<p>Here are two images of the Khmer Empire, one a satellite image and one a reconstructed map. These images show the wide extent of the empire, and how powerful it was. However, the only major sources of water are the two rivers on the right side, and the Tonle Sap Lake below, not pictured. To create an empire, the Khmer people had to use irrigation to bring this water into the reservoirs, the large blue rectangles, and the Great North Channel, in the top left corner. However, as the population increased, the strain on irrigation was too great; people were not able to get enough water as the irrigation systems collapsed. This was one of the main reasons for the Khmer Empire’s decline, first proposed by Bernard-Philippe Groslier in the early 1950s. A study by Damian Evans et al. published in 2007 confirms that "the fabric of residential life [was stretched] around and far beyond the infrastructural network, making it impossible for the reservoirs to sustain the empire.</p>

			<h3>Tree Rings: 1250-1500 CE</h3>

			<p>Tree rings been essential to finding reasons for the Khmer Empire's fall. In addition to irrigation strain, two droughts in the mid 14th and early 15th centuries, which was during the empire’s decline, dried up major water supplies and left the large nation stranded to support the massive population. The picture on the right shows an analysis of tree rings, showing that droughts in Angkor corresponded to weakened monsoons in surrounding areas like India and China, which means that there was a widespread lack of water. Since the Khmer Empire could not go elsewhere for water, it was not able to support farming for its population. Lack of water would have led to lack of food and cleaning, which would have led to revolts. In this way, droughts were "the demise of the vast urban complex of Greater Angkor" in the Khmer Empire (Buckley et al., 2009).</p>

			<p>This artifact was found in the Khmer Empire in the twelfth century, showing the gradual presence of Theravada Buddhism in the empire. Originally, the empire's main religions were Hinduism and Mahayana Buddhism, which allowed the emperors to claim divine right to the throne. However, Theravada Buddhism allowed equality and did not focus on having gods, which meant that the people would no longer believe in a holy force giving emperors the right to rule. As the new religion slowly spread, it soon became popular, and people did not need to focus on getting blessings from the ruler, who was in sole contact with Heaven, but could achieve their own spiritual happiness. With the leaders having less power, trust in the government fell, making rulers more accountable for their own actions, especially when declaring war, which was frowned upon in the Buddhist community. As the people shifted towards individual spiritual enlightenment, they became even more unhappy with the lack of water and food that resulted from natural disasters. This was a major factor in the fall of the Khmer Empire, which ultimately collapsed after invasion and internal revolution.
